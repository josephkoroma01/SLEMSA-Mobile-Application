SCOPHians perform different activities to raise awareness, educate and train general population on several health issues to prevent from Communicable to noncommunicable Diseases, to adopt healthy lifestyles addressing risk factors but also caring about the environment.\n\nRegional Priorities: \nPublic Health is a broad field and to focus specifically on some public health issues reflective of the countries priorities SCOPH has regional priorities of every region voted on upon by the National Public Health Officers: This does not imply that we are not working on other Public Health issues however due to the crucial nature and limited resources we have developed such priorities. The priorities are as follows:\n\nAfrica:NCDs \nAmericas: Mental Health; Universal Health Coverage\nAsia Pacific: Ageing\nEMR: Antimicrobial resistance\nEurope: Mental Health and Antimicrobial resistance\n\nSocial & Environmental Determinants of Health (SDH): are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems\n\nUniversal Health Coverage: SCOPHians are advocating in their countries to have a positive impact on equal, accessible and affordable high-quality universal health care. Coming from the principle of achieving health for all (3rd Sustainable Development Goal), it is the duty of medical students to support this movement for a better healthcare quality as well as physical and mental health status.\n\nHealth in All Policies (HiAP): is a movement that advocates for a collaborative approach to improving health of all people by taking in consideration health when making decisions in sectors other than health such as tobacco, food, migration, urbanization, climate change etc. The goal of HiAP is to ensure that decisions makers are well informed about impact their policies can have on health and to incorporate importance of health in their decision-making process.\n\nGlobal Health, International Health and Public Health: With the expansion of international aid in health crisis, the sense of globalization and trade, the term of global health and international health have emerged and have taken a certain value compared to public health.
